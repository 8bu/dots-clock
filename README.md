# Design Philosophy

## Goals

The clock is meant to simulate a living, breathing entity that, while displaying time information, is also an interesting and soothing experience to look at. It should interest the viewer and spark just enough to still disappear into the background of your living space. I would describe this attribute of the clock its "lava lampdness".
